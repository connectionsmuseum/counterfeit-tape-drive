These are tracks 1, 2, 3, and 4 recovered from the Western Electric No. 3 ESS data cartridge.
Each track is in its own .wav file and is labeled either A, B, C, or D.  Because I am not certain of the original tape orientation, I do not know which track is which.  I hope it will be obvious after we decode the data.

Note that it is possible that these tracks are reversed.  They can be reversed using any waveform editing program (such as Adobe Audition).

Playback speed was 3.75 ips using the original ESS tape drive head mounted on an Ampex 351 transport.  Head connections are shown on sheet B2A from Bell System SD 97736-01 drawing.  
  
Sampling rate was 192 kHz.

Playback was from the playback (read) side of a head removed from a KS21447 L2 mini recorder drive connected directly via shielded twisted-pair cable into the balanced mike input of a Tascam HD-P2 compact flash recorder.  No EQ was used.
